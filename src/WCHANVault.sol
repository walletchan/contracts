/**
 * @title WCHANVault (sWCHAN)
 * @notice ERC4626 vault for staking WCHAN. Depositors receive sWCHAN shares.
 *
 *         Two yield channels:
 *           1. WCHAN yield — anyone calls `donate()` to send WCHAN into the vault
 *              without receiving shares, raising the share price for all holders.
 *           2. WETH rewards — anyone calls `donateReward(amount)` to distribute
 *              WETH pro-rata to share holders via a Synthetix-style per-share
 *              accumulator. Stakers claim WETH via `claimRewards()`.
 *
 *         Early withdrawal penalty (WCHAN only): 20% linearly decaying to 0%
 *         over 7 days. 50% of penalty is burned, 50% stays in the vault as yield.
 *         WETH rewards have no penalty — they are earned yield, claimable anytime.
 *
 * @dev Fully permissionless — no owner, no fees, no access control.
 *
 *      WETH reward design (Synthetix pattern):
 *        - `rewardPerShareStored` tracks cumulative WETH per share (1e18 scaled).
 *        - On every balance change (deposit, withdraw, transfer), both `from` and
 *          `to` are snapshotted via `_snapshotReward` before `super._update`.
 *        - `earned(account)` = delta(rewardPerShare) × balance + buffered rewards.
 *        - WETH accounting is fully separate from ERC4626 — `totalAssets()` only
 *          counts WCHAN; WETH sits in the contract independently.
 *
 *      Penalty design:
 *        - Each address has a single weighted-average deposit timestamp.
 *        - On each deposit (or incoming share transfer), the timestamp is blended:
 *            newTs = (oldTs * existingShares + now * incomingShares) / totalShares
 *          This means a small top-up barely moves the timer, while a large one
 *          shifts it significantly. It's not gameable (depositing 1 wei doesn't reset).
 *        - Partial redeems do NOT reset or update the timer; only deposits/receives do.
 *
 *      ERC4626 note:
 *        `previewRedeem` / `previewWithdraw` return gross (pre-penalty) values because
 *        they have no `owner` parameter. Use `previewRedeemNet(shares, owner)` and
 *        `getPenaltyBps(owner)` for penalty-aware UI previews.
